        conditions of this Agreement.

        reseller of Ping Identity (a &quot;<strong>Reseller</strong>&quot;),

        the Products (including the scope of permitted use, quantities of
        licenses, etc.), and references to Order Forms herein will refer
        to such documentation., Customer should obtain such details from
        the Reseller, but Ping Identity can also confirm to Customer any
        such details of the subscription other than amounts payable. Fees
        and Taxes (if any) will be payable to Reseller, and the billing
        and payment terms will be determined pursuant to Customer&apos;s
        agreement(s) with Reseller in lieu of Section 4 hereof. Resellers
        have no authority to modify any of the terms of this Agreement,
        and may not grant Customer any rights to the Products beyond what
        is set forth in the ordering documentation between Ping Identity
        and Reseller.

        shall use the Products solely for its own business purposes in
        accordance with this Agreement and any related Order Form.
        Customer shall obtain any required authorizations or consents from
        Users for the transmission of Customer Data to Ping Identity and

        privacy rights; (ix) send or store Malicious Code; (x) interfere
        with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Fees &amp; Payment; Audit.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1 Fees.&emsp;</strong>Customer shall pay all fees
        specified in any Order Forms hereunder (the &quot;<strong>
          Fees
        </strong>&quot;). If Customer is purchasing through a Reseller,
        the applicable Fees will be set forth in Customer&apos;s ordering
        documentation with the Reseller and such Fees will be remitted to
        Reseller. Except as otherwise provided, all fees are quoted and
        payable in United States dollars. Except as otherwise specified
        herein or in an Order Form, stated fees are based on the scope of
        the Product subscriptions purchased and not actual usage, payment
        obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable.
        In the event that Customer is purchasing a subscription based on
        the number of individual Users, connections or another metric set
        forth in an Order Form, and Customer&apos;s actual usage exceeds
        the applicable limit on such metric, overage charges shall apply
        based on the then-current per-unit rate on the applicable Order
        Form and Customer shall remit such charges to Ping Identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2 Invoicing &amp; Payment Terms.&emsp;</strong>All Fees
        will be invoiced in advance and in accordance with the relevant
        Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in an Order Form, charges are
        due net thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. Customer is
        responsible for maintaining complete and accurate billing and
        contact information. This section does not apply if Customer is
        purchasing through a Reseller.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.3 Overdue Payments.&emsp;</strong>For those payments
        that are invoiced, any payment not received from Customer by the
        due date may accrue (except with respect to charges then under
        reasonable and good faith dispute), at Ping Identity&apos;s
        discretion, late charges at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding
        balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever
        is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.
        This section does not apply if Customer is purchasing through a
        Reseller.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.4 Taxes.&emsp;</strong>Ping Identity&apos;s invoices
        shall include any applicable direct or indirect local, state,
        federal or foreign taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental
        assessments of any nature, including value-added, use or
        withholding taxes (collectively, &quot;<strong>Taxes</strong>&quot;).
        Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its
        purchases hereunder, above and beyond the Fees, excluding taxes
        based on Ping Identity&apos;s net income or property, unless
        Customer provides Ping Identity with a valid tax exemption
        certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Unless
        otherwise stated, all prices set forth on an Order Form are
        exclusive of Taxes. This section does not apply if Customer is
        purchasing through a Reseller.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          4.5 Suspension of Service for Critical Cause.&emsp;
        </strong>
        &nbsp;Ping Identity reserves the right to suspend the Service
        provided to Customer if: (i)&nbsp;Customer is delinquent on any
        late payment obligations for more than thirty (30) days following
        written notice of such late payment; (ii)&nbsp;Ping Identity
        reasonably believes that suspension of the Service is necessary to
        comply with the law or requests of governmental entities; or
        (iii)&nbsp;Ping Identity reasonably determines that
        Customer&apos;s use of the Service in violation of this Agreement
        poses any security or vulnerability risk to Ping Identity or the
        Service. Customer shall only be responsible for fees and charges
        during the period of suspension if the underlying cause was
        Customer&apos;s breach of this Agreement. Ping Identity will
        endeavor to give advance notice of the suspension, to the extent
        it is able, taking into account the nature of the underlying
        cause. Ping Identity will restore access to the Service as soon as
        the underlying cause is mitigated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.6 Audit of Software Usage. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&emsp;(a) General.&emsp;</strong>Ping Identity will have
        the right, upon reasonable prior written notice to Customer, at a
        mutually agreeable time, and no more than once in any twelve (12)
        month period, to either audit or have an independent audit firm
        selected by Ping Identity audit Customer&apos;s equipment on which
        the Software is installed, and all related back-up files, to
        verify compliance with this Agreement. Any such audit will be
        conducted during normal business hours in a manner so as not to
        unreasonably interfere with Customer&apos;s normal operations.
        Such audits will be conducted at Ping Identity&apos;s expense. In
        the event that an audit reveals that Customer has failed to pay
        Fees consistent with its use of the Software, Customer will remit
        to Ping Identity the applicable Fees for the overuse, based on the
        then-current per-unit rate on the applicable Order Form(s), and
        reimburse Ping Identity for all reasonable costs and expenses
        incurred by Ping Identity in connection with such audit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&emsp;(b) PingIntelligence Reporting.&emsp;</strong>If
        Ping Identity requests, Customer will generate reports within the
        PingIntelligence Software within thirty (30) days of the end of
        each calendar quarter that show the monthly usage volume during
        each month of such quarter (even if a partial quarter), and will
        provide this report to Ping Identity. In addition to this report,
        if the PingIntelligence Software notifies Customer that its use of
        the PingIntelligence Software is in excess of the usage limits,
        Customer will notify Ping Identity. If the report or notice
        indicates that Customer&apos;s usage of the PingIntelligence
        Software is in excess of the usage limits, beginning on the first
        of the month following the deadline of the report or receipt of
        the notice, Customer will be upgraded to an increased usage limit
        corresponding to the increased usage amount for the remainder of
        the term of the applicable Order Form, at the then-current
        per-unit rate on such Order Form without requiring the execution
        of any variation documents or further Order Forms. Ping Identity
        will invoice Customer for the incremental cost of the new tier at
        such time, and upon future invoice dates if there are multiple
        payment dates on the applicable Order Form(s).

        marketing plans, technology and technical information, pricing
        information, financial results and information, product designs,
        product roadmaps, results of penetration testing, security reports
        or audits and business processes. Confidential Information shall
        not include any information that: (i)&nbsp;is or becomes generally
        known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the
        Disclosing Party; (ii)&nbsp;was known to the Receiving Party prior
        to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any
        obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (iii)&nbsp;was
        independently developed by the Receiving Party without breach of
        any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (iv)&nbsp;is
        received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed
        to the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information specifically
        excludes Customer Data. Customer Data obligations are set forth in
        Section 6 below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.2 Confidentiality.&emsp;</strong>The Receiving Party
        shall not disclose or use any Confidential Information of the
        Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this
        Agreement, except with the Disclosing Party&apos;s prior written
        permission. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential
        Information to its Affiliates and service providers on a
        need-to-know basis, and such Affiliates and service providers may
        use such Confidential Information, in each case only for the
        purposes of fulfilling Receiving Party&apos;s obligations under
        this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be liable to the
        Disclosing Party for all actions and omissions of its Affiliates
        and service providers with respect to such information as if such
        actions and omissions were those of the Receiving Party hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.3 Protection.&emsp;</strong>The Receiving Party agrees
        to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of
        the Disclosing Party in the same manner that it protects the
        confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential
        information of like kind (but in no event using less than
        reasonable care), and promptly notify the Disclosing Party upon
        discovery of any unauthorized access or acquisition of
        Confidential Information and reasonably cooperate with the
        Disclosing Party&apos;s efforts to prevent, investigate and
        remediate the breach of confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.4 Compelled Disclosure.&emsp;</strong>If the Receiving
        Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of
        the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with
        prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally
        permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing
        Party&apos;s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the
        disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.5 Remedies.&emsp;</strong>If the Receiving Party
        discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any
        Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in breach of
        confidentiality protections hereunder, the Disclosing Party shall
        have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it,
        to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being
        specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available
        remedies are inadequate.

      <p>
        <strong>6.1 Use of Customer Data.&emsp;</strong>Ping Identity
        shall not provide the Customer Data to any third parties except as
        necessary to operate the Service. As between Ping Identity and
        Customer, Customer owns all rights, title and interest in and to
        all Customer Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.2 Customer Responsibilities.&emsp;</strong>Customer is
        solely responsible for all activities that occur in any
        Users&apos; accounts and for compliance with this Agreement by
        Users. Customer shall: (i)&nbsp;have sole responsibility for the
        accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and
        appropriateness of all Customer Data submitted by it and its Users
        to the Service; and (ii)&nbsp;prevent unauthorized access to, or
        use of, the Service, and notify Ping Identity promptly of any such
        unauthorized access or use. If Customer becomes aware of any
        violation of Customer&apos;s obligations under this Agreement by
        any User, Customer will promptly notify Ping Identity and work
        with Ping Identity to promptly terminate access of any such User
        to the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.3 Nature of Customer Data.&emsp;</strong>Customer
        represents and warrants that it will not transmit or expose to
        Ping Identity any (i)&nbsp;protected health information (as that
        term is used in the Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)) or (ii)&nbsp;cardholder data
        (as regulated by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards
        Council) as a part of using the Products, in connection with
        Support Services, or otherwise under this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.4 Compliance with Laws.&emsp;</strong>Each Party shall
        comply with all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws
        in the provision and use of the Products under this Agreement.
        Customer agrees that it has sole control over the nature and scope
        of the Customer Data processed by the Products, and the origin or
        location of Users. As such, it is Customer&apos;s sole
        responsibility to (i)&nbsp;obtain all required authorizations or
        consents from Users for the processing of the Customer Data, and
        (ii)&nbsp;ascertain that such Customer Data can be processed under
        this Agreement by the Service and in connection with Support
        Services in accordance with applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.5 User Requests for Information.&emsp;</strong>If any
        User requests details of Customer Data of such User that is
        processed by Ping Identity, Ping Identity will promptly notify
        Customer, unless prohibited by applicable law or ongoing
        investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.6 Information Security.&emsp;</strong>Ping Identity will
        implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate technical,
        administrative and physical security measures designed to protect
        against unauthorized access to or use of Customer Data. Ping
        Identity shall, at a minimum, maintain the security of the Service
        and the Customer Data in accordance with the security exhibit
        available at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pingidentity.com/security-exhibit">

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.7 Audits and Security Assessments.&emsp;</strong>Ping
        Identity is and will remain in compliance with the most recent
        SOC-2 and ISO 27001 standards throughout the term of this
        Agreement. Upon Customer&apos;s written request, Ping Identity
        will provide Customer with access to Ping Identity&apos;s security
        portal that contains, among other things, a copy of (i)&nbsp;the
        most recently completed SOC-2 Type II audit report, (ii)&nbsp;its
        public ISO 27001 certificate and non-public Statement of
        Applicability, and (iii)&nbsp;the results of its most recently
        completed penetration testing on the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.8 Business Continuity/Disaster Recover.&emsp;</strong>During
        the term of this Agreement, Ping Identity will maintain and comply
        with its then-current Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
        Plans. Ping Identity will test such plans at least annually. Upon
        written request, Ping Identity will provide (i)&nbsp;a copy of the
        table of contents to such plan, and (ii)&nbsp;a summary of its
        annual testing results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.9 Retention and Destruction.&emsp;</strong>Upon
        Customer&apos;s written request Ping Identity will delete the
        Customer Data contained within the Service. Ping Identity will
        retain automated backup copies and log files generated by the
        Service that may contain Customer Data in accordance with Ping
        Identity&apos;s data retention policy. Such backup copies and log
        files will remain subject to Section 6 of this Agreement until
        deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.10 Breach Notification.&emsp;</strong>Ping Identity will
        promptly notify Customer upon becoming aware of any breach of
        security leading to the unauthorized access to or acquisition of
        Customer Data in Ping Identity&apos;s possession or under its
        control (a <strong>&quot;Security Incident&quot;</strong>). Each
        Party will reasonably cooperate with the other with respect to the
        investigation and remediation of any Security Incident including,
        in the case of Ping Identity, prompt provision of the following,
        to the extent then known to Ping Identity: (i)&nbsp;a description
        of the Security Incident, (ii)&nbsp;the categories and approximate
        numbers of impacted individuals, (iii)&nbsp;possible consequences
        of the Security Incident, (iv)&nbsp;corrective actions taken or to
        be taken by Ping Identity, if any, (v)&nbsp;internal point(s) of
        contact that Customer may engage for managing or responding to
        Customer about the Security Incident, and (vi)&nbsp;Ping
        Identity&apos;s Data Protection Officer&apos;s contact
        information. All Security Incident notifications will be provided
        in a manner reasonably designed to provide Customer with actual
        notice of the Security Incident in a time-effective manner. Ping
        Identity&apos;s obligation to report or respond to a Security
        Incident under this section is not an acknowledgement by Ping
        Identity of any fault or liability with respect to the Security
        Incident.

        Customer&apos;s use of the Service (&quot;<strong>
          Research Data
        </strong>&quot;) for its internal business purposes of research
        and development for future products and for the improvement of
        current product and service offerings. Nothing in this section
        shall permit Ping Identity to provide Research Data to any third
        parties other than as elsewhere permitted by this Agreement. In
        addition, Ping Identity may aggregate Research Data with other
        data and/or other usage statistics with respect to the Products,
        in each case so that results are non-personally identifiable with
        respect to Customer or any User (&quot;<strong>
          Aggregated Data
        </strong>&quot;). Ping Identity may utilize such Aggregated Data

        Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve
        Ping Identity&apos;s products and services and to create and
        distribute reports and other materials to third parties). For
        clarity, Ping Identity will only disclose Aggregated Data
        externally in a de-identified (anonymous) form that does not
        identify Customers or any Users, and that is stripped of all
        persistent identifiers (such as device identifiers, IP addresses,
        and cookie IDs). Ping Identity will retain, and Customer expressly
        disclaims, all intellectual property and other rights in any
        products or services Ping Identity develops pursuant to the usage
        rights herein, provided that no such products or services may
        contain any Customer Data.

        all rights, title and interest in and to the Products (and any
        enhancements, modifications, or derivative works thereof, or other
        software development performed by Ping Identity), including all

      <p>
        <strong>8.1 Warranties.&emsp;</strong>Each Party represents that
        it has the legal power to enter into this Agreement. Ping Identity
        warrants that it will provide the Products in a manner consistent
        with industry standards applicable to the provision thereof, and

        <strong>8.2 Performance Warranty for Software.&emsp;</strong>For a
        period of ninety (90) days after the date of delivery of the
        Software (the &quot;<strong>Warranty Period</strong>&quot;), Ping
        Identity warrants that the Software, when used as permitted by
        Ping Identity and in accordance with the Documentation, will

        material reproducible error that Customer reports to Ping Identity

        defective Software. In the event that Ping Identity, in its sole
        discretion, may not achieve either (i) or (ii) as a remedy for
        breach of this warranty, Ping Identity agrees to accept return of
        the Software, terminate the license to the defective Software and

        Code.

        <strong>9. Indemnification. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.1 Indemnification by Ping Identity.&emsp;</strong>Subject
        to the terms of the Agreement, Ping Identity will defend at its
        own expense any action against Customer brought by a third party
        alleging that the Products, in each case, as delivered, infringe
        any U.S. or EU patents issued as of the Effective Date or any
        copyrights or misappropriate any trade secrets, in each case, of a
        third party, and Ping Identity will indemnify and hold Customer
        harmless against those costs and damages finally awarded against
        Customer in any such action that are specifically attributable to
        such claim or those costs and damages agreed to in a monetary
        settlement of such action. The foregoing obligations are
        conditioned on Customer&apos;s compliance with the Indemnification
        Conditions (defined below). If the Products become, or in Ping
        Identity&apos;s opinion are likely to become, the subject of an
        infringement claim, Ping Identity may, at its option and expense,
        either: (i)&nbsp;procure for Customer the right to continue using
        the Products; (ii)&nbsp;replace or modify the Products so that
        they become non-infringing; or (iii)&nbsp;terminate the
        subscription to the infringing Products and refund Customer any
        unused, prepaid fees for the infringing Products covering the
        remainder of the subscription term after the date of termination.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ping Identity will have no
        obligation or liability under this Section&nbsp;9.1 or otherwise
        with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a)&nbsp;any
        use of the Products not in accordance with this Agreement;
        (b)&nbsp;any use of the Products in combination with products,
        equipment, software, or data not supplied or approved in writing
        by Ping Identity if such infringement would have been avoided but
        for the combination with other products, equipment, software or
        data; (c)&nbsp;any use of a prior release of the Software after a
        more current release has been made available to Customer; or
        (d)&nbsp;any modification of the Products by any person other than
        Ping Identity. THIS SECTION&nbsp;9.1 STATES PING IDENTITY&apos;S
        ENTIRE LIABILITY AND THE CUSTOMER&apos;S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
        CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.2 Indemnification by Customer.&emsp;</strong>Subject to
        the terms of this Agreement, Customer will defend at its own
        expense any action against Ping Identity brought by a third party
        (including any User) (i)&nbsp;alleging that Ping Identity&apos;s
        possession or use of the Customer Data violates, or
        misappropriates the rights of, or has otherwise harmed, a third
        party, or (ii)&nbsp;concerning a User&apos;s use of the Service
        (provided it is not due to Ping Identity&apos;s breach of this
        Agreement), and Customer will indemnify and hold Ping Identity
        harmless against those costs and damages finally awarded against
        Ping Identity in any such action that are specifically
        attributable to such claim or those costs and damages agreed to in
        a monetary settlement of such action. The foregoing obligations
        are conditioned on Ping Identity&apos;s compliance with the
        Indemnification Conditions (defined below).

        <strong>9.3 Indemnification Conditions.&emsp;</strong>
        &quot;<strong>Indemnification Conditions</strong>&quot;
        means the following conditions, which a Party must

        promptly in writing of such claim or allegation, setting forth in
        reasonable detail the facts and circumstances surrounding the
        claim; (ii)&nbsp;give the indemnifying Party sole control of the
        defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations, including
        not making any admission of liability or take any other action
        that limits the ability of the indemnifying Party to defend the
        claim; and (iii)&nbsp;cooperating and, at the indemnifying

        Customer has fully complied with these requirements. A Party may
        retain archived copies of Confidential Information or copies that

        remain subject to the restrictions herein for so long as they are
        retained.
